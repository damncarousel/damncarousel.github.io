#### The steps of the workflow

In any given CG production workflow, there are usually 5 steps that a CG artist must go through:

* Modeling: This step usually details the creation of the 3D model (usually by polygonal modeling). Points in 3D space are connected by line segments to form a polygonal mesh.
* Texturing: (also called texture mapping) when you add detail and texture to a 3D model to make it more realistic
* Animation: Taking the model and having it move through keyframes in a scene
* Lighting: Simulation of light in a 3D model or scene
* Rendering: The conversion of the 3D model and scene into a 2D raster image
